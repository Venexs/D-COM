# D-COM

Just a funny little program I made to prank my friend into thinking that I hacked into some Multiverse ship. Use it to prank your friend too. 

I might just make this into an Analog game

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these modules.

Termcolor

```bash
pip install termcolor
```
Colorama

```bash
pip install colorama
```

Other Modules are part of the standard library

## Usage

Run the main.bat file in the main folder to start the program.

May have to change the variable 'on' in the code, to 0 or 2 to get the appropriate result
